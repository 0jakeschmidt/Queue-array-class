# Program #1

Name: Jacob Schmidt

How to compile:
  I included a Makefile
  
  once in the directory commands for terminal 
  
  make all
  ./driver
  
  
  

Anything not working:
  To the best of my knowledge everything is working properly
  although I will say I wish i could have made Qstate more efficient.
  
  I didn't receive any help on this project other than watching a few videos on 
  creating Makefiles
